# SOC-Simulation-Project
 Wazuh-Based SOC Simulation

Scope

This project sets up a Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation using three virtual machines:

1.	Wazuh VM (Ubuntu 22.0.4.5): Serves as the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool, collecting and analyzing logs from the other VMs.
2.	Endpoint VM (Windows 10): Simulates a real-world endpoint, monitored by Wazuh for suspicious activity.
3.	Threat Actor VM (Kali Linux): Acts as the attacker, performing simulated attacks on the Windows VM.


Goals
1.	Simulate Real-World SOC
2.	Demonstrate Threat Detection
3.	Simulate Attacks & Test Detection
4.	Visualize & Report Findings
5.	Incident Response
6.	Document & Share Findings
